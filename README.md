# AIRBNB-Data-Analysis
A great repo for indepth Data Analysis
## Dataset

[Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) has provided data that is sourced from public available infomration from Airbnb webiste. The data we used for this project is compiled on 6th of September, 2023. The dataset comprised of three tables and a geojson file of London boroughs:
* `listings` - Deatailed listings data for London
* `calendar` - Deatailed bookings for the next calendar year of listings
* `reviews` - Detailed reviews data for listings in London.
* `neigbourhoods` - geojson file of boroughs of London.


# Questions to be Answered.

 * `1. Which Boroughs are more expensive and which area have the best reviews.`
 * `2. Which property type has highest listening and what room type has higher price `
 * `3. What are the essential ammenities needed `?
 * `4. What is the correlation of their remarks with the reviews `
 * `5. What Features affect price the most and what features affect the average price over time. `
 * `6. What is the Impact of external factors such as Economic Indicators to the Price `
 * `7. Which Features affect the book rate the most `
 * `8. Which month is the most expensive month to travel on ` 
 * `9. How is the demand for Airbnb changing in London and the number of reviews across the years. `
 * `10.Use time series analysis (e.g., SARIMA) to detect seasonal trends in prices and occupancy `

 ## In this project I dealt extensively with  different frameworks which are

 * Machine Learning Frameworks for feature importance, Sentimental Analysis and feature selection
 * Pyspark for Big Data Processing
 * Correlation and Seasonal Decomposition Analysis
 * Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
 * Economic Indicator analysis  and correlation
